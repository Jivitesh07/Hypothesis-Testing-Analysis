Final Recommendation – A/B Testing

Objective:
The goal of this A/B test was to determine whether the Test version performs better than the Control version in terms of conversion rate.

Summary of Analysis:
- The conversion rate of the Test group is higher than that of the Control group.
- A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean conversion rates.
- The p-value obtained from the test is less than the significance level (α = 0.05).

Statistical Conclusion:
Since the p-value is below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
This indicates that the difference in conversion rates between the Control and Test groups is statistically significant.
